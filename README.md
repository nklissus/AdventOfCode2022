# Advent of Code 2022
This repository will be used to store my work for the 2022 installment of Advent of Code. As I write this I think I would like to practice a new language so I've selected C++ since it's quite different from Python and will be useful in future electronics projects. -- Please forgive my newbie mistakes --
